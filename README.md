# HR-Data-Analysis
I have developed the HR Analytics Dashboard to analyze employee attrition, covering total employees, attrition rate, average age, salary, and tenure. It segments attrition by education, age, salary, experience, job role, and gender, helping HR teams identify trends and improve retention strategies.
