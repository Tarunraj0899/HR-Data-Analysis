# HR Analytics Dashboard (Employee Attrition Analysis using Power BI)

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze employee attrition patterns, identify key factors contributing to employee turnover, and provide actionable insights to reduce attrition and improve workforce retention. This includes evaluating demographic factors, salary levels, tenure, and job roles to make data-driven HR decisions.

## Dataset used
- <a hres="https://github.com/Tarunraj0899/HR-Data-Analysis/blob/main/HR_Analytics.csv">Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
- What is the overall attrition rate, and how does it vary across departments?
- Which job roles have the highest attrition rates?
- How does attrition vary by education level?
- What is the trend of attrition based on employee age groups?
- Which salary slab experiences the highest employee turnover?
- What is the average tenure of employees who leave the company?
- How does gender influence attrition rates?
- Which employee groups (age, experience, job role) should HR focus on for retention?

## Process
- Verify data for missing values and anomalies to ensure data integrity.
- Standardize and clean the data for consistency in salary, job roles, and tenure.
- Create pivot tables to analyze attrition trends by age, education, salary, gender, and job roles.
- Segment the data into visual charts and graphs to identify key insights.
- Merge all pivot tables into a dynamic dashboard with interactive filters.

## Project Insight
- The overall attrition rate is 16.2%, with 238 employees leaving the company.
- Sales Executives and Laboratory Technicians have the highest attrition rates, with Sales Executives losing 62 employees and Laboratory Technicians losing 62 employees.
- Employees with 1-2 years of experience are most likely to leave, peaking at 59 employees at the 1-year mark.
- The majority of employees leaving (163) fall in the "Up to 5k" salary slab, indicating lower-paid employees are more likely to quit.
- Medical (26%) and Life Sciences (37%) graduates contribute the most to attrition, possibly due to better opportunities elsewhere.
- The 26-35 age group sees the highest attrition, with 116 employees leaving in this range.
- Men have a higher attrition rate than women, with 889 male employees vs. 591 female employees leaving.

## Final Conclusion
To reduce employee attrition, HR should focus on retaining Sales Executives and Laboratory Technicians, as these roles experience the highest turnover. The organization should introduce better salary packages, employee benefits, and career development programs, particularly for lower-salaried employees and those in the 26-35 age group. Targeted retention strategies, such as mentorship programs and flexible work policies, should be implemented for employees with 1-2 years of tenure to improve long-term retention.
